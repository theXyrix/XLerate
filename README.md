# 🩺 Medora — AI-Powered Personal Health Copilot

### **Your Health History. One Clear Story.**

Medora is an **AI-powered Personal Health Copilot** designed to help people understand, organize, compare, and manage information contained in their healthcare records.

Instead of keeping medical information scattered across prescriptions, laboratory reports, diagnostic records, and discharge summaries, Medora brings everything into one unified health journey.

> **Upload → Extract → Understand → Compare → Track → Discuss**

---

## 🌟 Overview

Healthcare information is often fragmented across multiple documents.

Patients may have:

* 📄 Laboratory reports
* 💊 Prescriptions
* 🏥 Discharge summaries
* 🧪 Diagnostic reports
* 📋 Medical records
* 📊 Historical test results

Understanding these documents and identifying changes over time can be difficult.

**Medora** uses OCR, AI, structured medical data, timelines, charts, and multilingual support to make healthcare information easier to understand.

### Medora helps users:

✅ Upload medical documents
✅ Extract information using OCR
✅ Understand medical terminology
✅ View reported values and reference ranges
✅ Compare previous and latest reports
✅ Identify trends over time
✅ Organize medications
✅ Build a unified health timeline
✅ Prepare questions for a doctor
✅ Ask questions about uploaded records
✅ Access the application in multiple Indian languages

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare data is fragmented and difficult for patients to understand.

Important information may be distributed across:

```text
Prescription
     +
Lab Report
     +
Diagnostic Report
     +
Discharge Summary
     +
Previous Medical Records
```

This creates several problems:

* Patients struggle to understand medical terminology.
* Important values can be difficult to interpret.
* Historical changes are difficult to identify.
* Medical documents are not organized into one timeline.
* Patients may forget important information during doctor visits.
* Language can become an additional barrier.

### 💡 Our Solution

Medora transforms fragmented healthcare documents into an understandable health journey.

# 🚀 Key Features

## 📄 1. Medical Document OCR

Upload:

* PDF
* JPG
* JPEG
* PNG

Medora uses **PaddleOCR** to extract text from medical documents.

Supported document types include:

* Prescriptions
* Lab reports
* Diagnostic reports
* Discharge summaries
* Medical records

---

## 🤖 2. AI Medical Information Extraction

The system converts unstructured medical documents into structured information.

Example:

```json
{
  "document_type": "lab_report",
  "date": "2026-09-28",
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "Hemoglobin",
      "value": 10.2,
      "unit": "g/dL",
      "reference_range": "12-16",
      "status": "below_range",
      "confidence": 0.97
    }
  ]
}
```

For prescriptions:

```json
{
  "document_type": "prescription",
  "medications": [
    {
      "name": "Example Medicine",
      "dosage": "500 mg",
      "frequency": "twice daily",
      "duration": "30 days"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

# 🧠 3. AI Health Summary

Medora converts complex healthcare information into simple language.

### Example

Instead of presenting only:

> Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL

Medora can explain:

> The reported hemoglobin value is 10.2 g/dL, which is below the reference range shown on this report.

The system avoids unsupported medical conclusions.

---

# 📊 4. What Changed?

One of Medora's major features is historical report comparison.

Users can compare:

```text
Previous Report
       ↓
Latest Report
       ↓
Changes
```

Example:

| Test       |  Previous |    Latest | Change |
| ---------- | --------: | --------: | -----: |
| Hemoglobin | 11.4 g/dL | 10.2 g/dL |   -1.2 |
| Vitamin D  |  22 ng/mL |  14 ng/mL |     -8 |
| Glucose    | 102 mg/dL |  98 mg/dL |     -4 |

Medora highlights:

* New values
* Changed values
* Values outside provided ranges
* Historical changes

---

# 📈 5. Health Trends

Medora converts historical health data into interactive charts.

Supported examples:

* Hemoglobin
* Vitamin D
* Glucose
* Cholesterol
* Blood pressure

Built using:

**Recharts**

Example:

```text
12.8
  \
   11.4
      \
       10.2
```

Users can hover over data points to see:

* Value
* Date
* Unit
* Source report

---

# 🕒 6. Unified Health Timeline

Medora organizes healthcare events chronologically.

Example:

```text
October 2026
│
├── Lab Report
│   Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
│
├── Prescription
│   2 medications
│
September 2026
│
├── Lab Report
│   Vitamin D: 14 ng/mL
│
August 2026
│
└── Doctor Visit
```

Each timeline event can connect back to its source document.

---

# 💊 7. Medication Summary

Medora extracts prescription information and organizes it into a structured view.

Displays:

* Medicine name
* Dosage
* Frequency
* Duration
* Prescription date
* Source document

### Important

Medora does **not** recommend medication changes.

---

# 🔎 8. Evidence-Linked AI

AI-generated insights should be connected to the underlying evidence.

Example:

```text
AI Insight

Vitamin D is below the reference range
shown on the latest report.

Confidence: 96%

Source:
Lab Report — 28 Sep 2026

[View Evidence]
```

Users can inspect:

* Original document
* Extracted value
* Reference range
* Date
* OCR confidence

This helps improve transparency and trust.

---

# 🧑‍⚕️ 9. Doctor Visit Copilot

Medora helps users prepare for conversations with healthcare professionals.

It can generate neutral questions such as:

> What could be contributing to this change in the reported value?

> Should this result be reviewed alongside my previous results?

> Is any follow-up recommended for this result?

The system does not prescribe treatment.

---

# 💬 10. AI Health Chat

Medora includes an interactive AI chat assistant.

Users can ask:

```text
"Explain my latest lab report."

"What changed between my last two reports?"

"Which values are outside the provided range?"

"Summarize my prescription."

"Explain this medical term."

"What questions should I ask my doctor?"

"Show my Vitamin D trend."
```

The AI uses uploaded health records as context.

When possible, responses include:

```text
Source:
Lab Report — 28 Sep 2026

[View Evidence]
```

---

* DocumentReference
* Encounter

Example:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "id": "obs-001",
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/001"
  },
  "code": {

# 💡 What Makes Medora Different?

Medora is not simply an OCR tool.

The core idea is:

> **Connect the patient's healthcare records into one understandable story.**

Traditional workflow:

```text
Report 1 → Read
Report 2 → Read
Report 3 → Read
```

Medora:

```text
Report 1
   ↓
Report 2
   ↓
Report 3
   ↓
Compare
   ↓
Identify Trends
   ↓
Build Timeline
   ↓
Explain
   ↓
Prepare for Doctor
```

### Core Differentiator

> **"Medora doesn't just read a medical document. It connects healthcare records over time into one understandable health story."**

---

# 📌 Future Enhancements
